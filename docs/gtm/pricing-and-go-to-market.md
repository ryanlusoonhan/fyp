# Nell MVP Pricing & GTM Blueprint

## Monetization Thesis

People pay for **decision confidence + workflow speed**, not for raw model output.

## Packaging

- **Free ($0)**: delayed preview, limited history, methodology trust-building.
- **Pro ($39/mo)**: live signal, full history, explainability, alerts.
- **Elite ($79/mo)**: scenario lab, deeper walk-forward diagnostics, exports.

## Recommended Acquisition Channels

1. **Content-led trust**  
   - Weekly post: signal outcome + what changed + invalidation status.
   - Explainability snippets to demonstrate transparency.

2. **Proof-led product marketing**  
   - Public mini dashboard with delayed data and walk-forward highlights.
   - Side-by-side “what free users see vs paid users unlock.”

3. **Community distribution**  
   - Share signal retrospectives in trader communities.
   - Offer Pro trial credits for high-quality feedback cohorts.

4. **Partner/referral motion**  
   - Trading educators and newsletters as affiliate partners.
   - Referral rewards tied to first paid month retention.

## Conversion Strategy

- Primary CTA from landing: **Open Terminal** (show value quickly).
- Upgrade triggers:
  - user hits explainability gate
  - user opens scenario lab
  - user requests full history/export
- Pricing page emphasizes:
  - what is unlocked per tier
  - clear non-advice compliance language
  - immediate checkout with minimal friction

## KPI Stack

- Visitor -> dashboard activation
- Activation -> free account creation
- Free -> paid conversion (14/30-day)
- Pro -> Elite expansion rate
- Monthly churn by tier
- Signal engagement (views/week, scenario runs/user)

## 90-Day MVP Validation Targets

- 20-30% visitor-to-activation on the landing flow.
- 8-12% free-to-paid conversion among activated users.
- < 8% monthly churn on Pro after first billing cycle.
- > 40% weekly active usage for paid users.
