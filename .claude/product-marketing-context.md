# Nell Signal Terminal - Product Marketing Context

## 1) Product Overview

- **One-line description**: Nell Signal Terminal is an explainable weekly HSI signal platform that converts model output into decision-ready intelligence.
- **What it does**: The product ingests the weekly model output (BUY/NO_BUY + probability), enriches it with threshold logic, walk-forward analytics, and scenario stress testing, then delivers a terminal-style dashboard and APIs for traders.
- **Category**: Quant signal intelligence / trading decision support analytics.
- **Product type**: SaaS analytics platform (subscription).

## 2) ICP and Segments

- **Primary ICP**: Independent and semi-professional index traders focused on Hang Seng Index exposure.
- **Secondary ICP**: Small research desks and trading communities that need a transparent model layer.
- **Buying criteria**:
  - Clear confidence and invalidation logic (not just directional output)
  - Robustness evidence (walk-forward windows)
  - Practical workflow integration (dashboard + API + alerts)

## 3) Core Jobs To Be Done

- Decide whether to add/hold/reduce weekly HSI risk with structured evidence.
- Understand when the model is likely wrong or weak-confidence.
- Compare model strategy behavior versus buy-and-hold in rolling windows.
- Pressure-test threshold and cost assumptions before acting.

## 4) Key Value Pillars

1. **Explainability-first signal output**: Confidence bands, key drivers, and invalidation triggers.
2. **Truth-over-story performance layer**: Walk-forward windows and summary metrics by period.
3. **Decision simulation**: Scenario Lab for threshold/objective sensitivity.
4. **Operational consistency**: Weekly cadence and reproducible signal reporting.

## 5) Positioning

- **For** traders who want quant discipline without black-box opacity,
- **Nell Signal Terminal** is a signal intelligence terminal
- **that** combines weekly BUY/NO_BUY model output with confidence explainability, walk-forward robustness, and scenario testing,
- **unlike** basic signal bots that provide direction without evidence.

## 6) Feature Packaging

- **Free**: Delayed/limited preview, market brief, methodology visibility.
- **Pro ($39/mo)**: Live signal, full signal history, explainability, alerts.
- **Elite ($79/mo)**: Pro + Scenario Lab + walk-forward deep dive + exports.

## 7) Pricing and Monetization Logic

- **Monetization driver**: Pay for decision confidence and workflow speed, not raw signal access alone.
- **Expansion path**:
  1. Free trust building (methodology + delayed preview)
  2. Pro for active weekly execution workflow
  3. Elite for deeper risk/threshold modeling

## 8) Evidence and Trust Assets

- Latest 100-period metrics (accuracy/F1 and strategy return vs benchmark)
- Walk-forward window breakdown
- Model version and as-of timestamp in signal report
- Ingestion endpoint for persistent audit trail

## 9) Compliance and Risk Posture

- Product is educational analytics and decision support.
- Not auto-trading; not a broker; no execution guarantees.
- Users retain responsibility for position sizing and risk management.

## 10) Messaging Guardrails

- Avoid language that implies guaranteed outcomes.
- Lead with transparency, process discipline, and evidence depth.
- Keep claims scoped to historical and scenario analysis.
